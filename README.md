# HR-ANALYTICS-REPORT

# Introduction

This HR analytics project focuses on analyzing employee data to uncover key factors affecting attrition, job satisfaction, and workforce demographics. By examining comprehensive employee records, the analysis seeks to identify trends in turnover, compensation, and engagement. The dataset includes detailed information on employee demographics, employment history, job roles, and satisfaction levels, providing a robust foundation for understanding the dynamics of employee retention and attrition within the organization.

The primary objective of this analysis is to provide actionable insights into the workforce’s satisfaction, salary progression, and reasons for termination. Understanding these patterns will enable the organization to develop strategies that improve retention, enhance employee engagement, and create a more satisfying work environment. Additionally, the analysis aims to highlight disparities across gender, age groups, and job roles to inform equitable policies and targeted interventions.

This project delivers a data-driven overview of the organization’s HR landscape, equipping decision-makers with the insights needed to enhance overall employee experience and reduce turnover.

# Objectives of the Analysis

*Attrition and Termination Insights:*

-Identify key factors contributing to employee attrition, including gender, marital status, job satisfaction, and work-life balance.

-Track termination rates over time, by quarter and month, to understand seasonal patterns or specific times when employees are more likely to leave the organization.

 *Employee Satisfaction and Work-Life Balance:*

-Analyze the relationship between job satisfaction, work-life balance, and attrition rates.

-Understand how employees with different satisfaction levels (e.g., very high, high, low) are distributed across the organization and how these factors impact turnover.

 *Salary and Compensation Trends:*

-Examine salary progression over years of service and identify discrepancies between male and female employees.

-Analyze salary trends over time and assess how compensation influences employee retention, particularly for long-tenured employees.

-Review monthly salary distributions to detect any irregularities or trends in compensation that might affect satisfaction or attrition.

 *Demographics and Retention:*

-Assess how demographic factors such as gender, education level, and marital status impact termination rates and retention.

-Examine the distribution of employees by education level and its potential influence on job satisfaction, performance, and retention.

 *Employee Retention and Organizational Health:*

-Track total retention and termination rates to measure overall organizational health, evaluating whether the retention rate aligns with the company’s goals.

-Identify the departments or job roles where retention is strongest or weakest, allowing for targeted interventions to improve workforce stability.
