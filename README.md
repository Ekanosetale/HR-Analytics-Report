# HR-ANALYTICS-REPORT

# Introduction

This HR analytics project focuses on analyzing employee data to uncover key factors affecting attrition, job satisfaction, and workforce demographics. By examining comprehensive employee records, the analysis seeks to identify trends in turnover, compensation, and engagement. The dataset includes detailed information on employee demographics, employment history, job roles, and satisfaction levels, providing a robust foundation for understanding the dynamics of employee retention and attrition within the organization.

The primary objective of this analysis is to provide actionable insights into the workforce’s satisfaction, salary progression, and reasons for termination. Understanding these patterns will enable the organization to develop strategies that improve retention, enhance employee engagement, and create a more satisfying work environment. Additionally, the analysis aims to highlight disparities across gender, age groups, and job roles to inform equitable policies and targeted interventions.

This project delivers a data-driven overview of the organization’s HR landscape, equipping decision-makers with the insights needed to enhance overall employee experience and reduce turnover.

# Tool used: 
Power BI

# Objectives of the Analysis

*Attrition and Termination Insights:*

-Identify key factors contributing to employee attrition, including gender, marital status, job satisfaction, and work-life balance.

-Track termination rates over time, by quarter and month, to understand seasonal patterns or specific times when employees are more likely to leave the organization.

 *Employee Satisfaction and Work-Life Balance:*

-Analyze the relationship between job satisfaction, work-life balance, and attrition rates.

-Understand how employees with different satisfaction levels (e.g., very high, high, low) are distributed across the organization and how these factors impact turnover.

 *Salary and Compensation Trends:*

-Examine salary progression over years of service and identify discrepancies between male and female employees.

-Analyze salary trends over time and assess how compensation influences employee retention, particularly for long-tenured employees.

-Review monthly salary distributions to detect any irregularities or trends in compensation that might affect satisfaction or attrition.

 *Demographics and Retention:*

-Assess how demographic factors such as gender, education level, and marital status impact termination rates and retention.

-Examine the distribution of employees by education level and its potential influence on job satisfaction, performance, and retention.

 *Employee Retention and Organizational Health:*

-Track total retention and termination rates to measure overall organizational health, evaluating whether the retention rate aligns with the company’s goals.

-Identify the departments or job roles where retention is strongest or weakest, allowing for targeted interventions to improve workforce stability.

# Discussion of Findings

![](HRDashboard1.jpg)

The termination rate (16%) is moderate but warrants attention to identify the underlying factors causing employees to leave. The 84% retention rate is generally positive but can be improved.

There is a higher termination rate among male employees compared to females. This could indicate gender-specific issues or roles that need further investigation

Interestingly, more employees with high job satisfaction left (73 terminations). However, the termination rate is highest (23%) among those with low job satisfaction, indicating that satisfaction levels significantly affect turnover rates.

Bad work-life balance is the leading cause of terminations. Addressing this issue by improving work-life flexibility and support could reduce employee turnover.

Single employees show a significantly higher termination rate. This may imply that married or divorced individuals have greater stability or commitment, which could influence retention strategies.

There is a trend where employees terminate early in the year, perhaps after performance reviews or bonus payouts. A similar spike occurs in mid-year, potentially after mid-year reviews or workload increases.

The third quarter experiences the highest termination rate, while the fourth quarter has the lowest. This trend may suggest that employees are less likely to leave towards the end of the year, potentially due to upcoming year-end bonuses or other benefits.

Comparison of Salaries: The dashboard shows that male employees have consistently earned higher salaries than their female counterparts throughout their tenure in the organization. This trend raises concerns regarding gender pay equity and suggests the need for a deeper analysis to understand the underlying factors contributing to this disparity.

Peak and Decline in Salaries: Salaries peak at $846K during the early years of employment but show a significant decline to $11K by year 30. This indicates potential issues with long-term retention or salary adjustments, suggesting that the organization may not be adequately compensating employees who have been with the company for extended periods.

The Total Salary Per Month graph indicates fluctuations in total salary expenditures, with certain months, such as October and November, showing higher total salaries (around $910K). This might correlate with performance evaluations, bonuses, or seasonal hiring trends, suggesting the need for careful budgeting in these months.

The majority of employees report their satisfaction levels as high (442 employees), while there are 289 employees who report low satisfaction. This disparity indicates a critical need for the organization to understand and address the factors contributing to low satisfaction, as dissatisfied employees may be more prone to leaving the organization.

The workforce primarily consists of employees with a Bachelor's degree, followed by those with a Master's degree (398 employees). There is a noticeable decrease in employees with lower educational qualifications, such as Below College (170) and Doctorate (48). This distribution highlights the potential need for targeted recruitment and development programs to ensure a skilled workforce aligned with the organization’s goals.
